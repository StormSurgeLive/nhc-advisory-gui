# Contributions

This project is not yet open for code contributors, the GUI layout and
workflow is still being established. It is currently using wxGlade to
generate the GUI; and wxPerl to render the GUI and handle the events and
user interactions.

# Plans

I usually do not outline plans for things, but since this is a relatively
well scoped project, the goals here are to:

- monitor and alert users to a storm that is updated in the CurrentStorms.json (during the regular hurricane season
- present a clickable tree view of all the information present in the NHC JSON
- allow for the browsing and exploration of some of the JSON files archived in the ASGS "storm-archive" repo
- OS environment target is primarily Windows
